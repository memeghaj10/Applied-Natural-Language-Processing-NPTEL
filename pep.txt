Letter received from Rashmi Kant Kanji from Portugal 
Pushpendra Kulshrestha, Pushpendra ji, When I went first time to Mathura with my widowed mother she went to Yamuna Ji river and was crying there was not enough turtle and waters, it was evening we made a Yamunaji arti and morning we went to Gokul... After when we come again to Mathura I ask my mother to go Krishna temple and she start to cry again as she refuse to go as he told still Krishna is not free and she can't see the mosque and she kept literally crying and we return to hotel at Vrindavan area.. We had a century old Brahimns who kept files of our Gotras and data and he was with us and he explain me don't push her. My mother then want to eat and I told her will go center and she say was tired and I told her that will try to take car as much as near places to she will not need to walk .. As, since we reach Mathura my mother was eating at every place, as usually she don't do so I ask her and she say these is VRAJBHUMI can eat every were which was pure food not onion and garlic and the Hotel were we staying belong to Muslim gentleman and he was serving all meat and I don't want to tell my mother to make her more sad... So, these Vrajbhumi must declare Hindu sanctuary and must follow the rules accordingly... Many hotel and restaurants are with name of Hindu deity in Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul and they are own by Muslims and they sold all kind of meat and all even forbidden meat ... Before all was outside and now they are near to encroach all places .... very sad no respect to next person as they call we are peaceful people why they do it.
